# Djanswer (W.I.P.)
Funny, quiplash-like game.
At the begging of each round, players will write a question, then answer a random question (not their own).
After everybody has answered, a vote will take place to determine the most funny question+answer.
Only the player that asked the question and the player that answered it will receive points.
The player with the most points win!
